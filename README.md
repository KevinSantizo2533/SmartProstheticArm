## Project Goal
The focus of this project is a synthetic arm meant to benefit disabled individuals. This arm will have many functions, including temperature measurement, object detection, rotational axes (servos) and supports bluetooth/wireless connection. These functionalities will all be displayed to an app for the user to get all the information necessary to help with their everyday lives.
